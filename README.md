# Brent_kung_adder
Module Name:
generic_BKA
Description:
This Verilog module implements a brent-Kung Adder (BKA) for a 64-bit binary adder using a prefix tree approach. The module is parameterized by n, the bit-width of the input operands.

Parameters:
n: The bit-width of the input operands. Must be a power of 2 (e.g., 64, 128, 256).
Inputs:
cin: 1-bit input that represents the carry-in.
a, b: n-bit inputs representing the two operands to be added.
Outputs:
sum: n-bit output representing the sum of the two operands.
cout: 1-bit output representing the carry-out.
Functionality:
The generic_BKA module performs binary addition using the following steps:

Generate and Propagate Signals:

The initial propagate (p) and generate (g) signals are computed for the input operands a and b.
This is done using a custom gen_prop module that outputs two n-bit vectors (r for generate and f for propagate).
Prefix Tree Calculation:

The module uses a prefix tree to calculate the final carry-out. The prefix tree reduces the width of the operands iteratively, passing generate and propagate signals from one stage to the next.
For i iterations (from 0 to log2(n)-1), the size of the wire arrays used is [(n/2 >> i) - 1:0].
At each stage, the propagate and generate signals are updated for the next stage.
Carry Computation:

The final carry-out (cout) is computed using the calculated propagate signals from the last stage of the prefix tree.
The sum (sum) is generated using the final propagate signal XORed with the carry-in and intermediate carry-out values.
Example Instantiation:
verilog
Copy code
generic_BKA #(64) adder (
    .cin(cin),
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .sum(sum),
    .cout(cout)
);
Usage Notes:
Ensure that n is a power of 2 to use this module.
The module is optimized for high-speed binary addition and provides low latency by using a carry-lookahead technique.
